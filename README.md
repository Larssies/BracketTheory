A JavaScript Bracket Usage Performance Comparison

## Overview

This project aims to compare the performance of different ways to define functions in JavaScript using `{}` brackets. We will measure the execution time of two common function declaration styles: traditional function declarations and arrow functions, to determine which is faster.

 ## How to run?
- go to **`Terminal`**
- Press **`New Terminal`**
- Type **`node bracket_logic.js`**
- Press Enter
- View the results

## Results
After running the script, you will see the execution times for traditional function declarations and arrow functions. Based on these results, you can determine which function declaration style is more performant for your specific use case.

## Conclusion
This project provides a simple way to compare the performance of different ways to define functions in JavaScript using {} brackets. Use the results to make informed decisions when writing your code.
